# HelloWorld.sol

This is a super simple “Hello World” smart contract to display a string of "Hello World!" 
Accompanied also is a storeNumber function to store an unsigned integer and then a retrieveNumber function to retrieve it.

This smart contract is actually written in Solidity and would only get better from here.
